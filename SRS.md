# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a To-Do List Web Application

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a detailed description of the requirements for a full-stack To-Do List web application. The purpose of this application is to help users manage their tasks effectively with data persisted on a server.

### 1.2 Scope

The application will allow users to create, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The system will be composed of a client-side frontend application and a server-side backend application that communicate via a RESTful API. Data will be stored in a central database. Future versions may include user accounts and authentication.

### 1.3 Target Audience

This document is intended for project stakeholders, including developers, testers, and project managers.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The To-Do List web application is a new product built on a modern client-server architecture.

### 2.2 Product Features

The main features of the application are:
*   Adding new tasks
*   Viewing the list of tasks
*   Editing existing tasks
*   Deleting tasks
*   Marking tasks as complete or incomplete
*   Persisting tasks in a database

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

The primary user is anyone who wants to manage a list of tasks. No special technical skills are required.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

*   **Frontend:** The client application will be a web-based application running in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). It will be built using the React.js library.
*   **Backend:** The server application will be a REST API built with the Python FastAPI framework.
*   **Database:** The system will use an SQLite database for data persistence.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

*   The frontend application must be a single-page application (SPA) for a fluid user experience.
*   The backend must expose a well-defined RESTful API for communication with the frontend.
*   The code for the frontend and backend should be maintained in separate directories.

## 3. System Features (Functional Requirements)

### 3.1 Frontend Application

*   **FR-1:** The user shall be able to add a new task through the UI.
*   **FR-2:** The user shall be able to view a list of all their tasks.
*   **FR-3:** The user shall be able to edit the description of an existing task.
*   **FR-4:** The user shall be able to delete a task from the list.
*   **FR-5:** The user shall be able to mark a task as "complete" or "incomplete".
*   **FR-6:** Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from incomplete tasks (e.g., with a strikethrough).

### 3.2 Backend API

*   **FR-7:** The API shall provide endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) tasks.
*   **FR-8:** The API shall validate all incoming data to ensure its integrity.
*   **FR-9:** A newly created task shall be marked as "incomplete" by default in the database.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces

The application will have a clean, simple, and responsive user interface built with React components. It will provide clear visual feedback for all user actions (e.g., loading states, success messages, error notifications).

### 4.2 API Interfaces

The backend will provide a RESTful API over HTTP. The API will use JSON for all request and response bodies. (See the Technical Design Document for detailed endpoint specifications).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

*   **NFR-1:** The initial application load should be under 3 seconds on a standard internet connection.
*   **NFR-2:** API responses for typical requests should be returned in under 500ms.
*   **NFR-3:** UI updates should feel instantaneous to the user.

### 5.2 Usability

*   **NFR-4:** The application should be intuitive and easy to use for non-technical users.
*   **NFR-5:** All functionalities should be discoverable and accessible with minimal clicks.

### 5.3 Reliability

*   **NFR-6:** The application should function correctly in the specified browsers.
*   **NFR-7:** Task data shall be reliably persisted in the server-side database.

### 5.4 Security

*   **NFR-8:** The backend API should be protected against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **NFR-9:** (Future) If user authentication is added, passwords must be securely hashed and all sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.

### 5.5 Maintainability

*   **NFR-10:** The code should be well-structured, commented, and separated into frontend and backend concerns to facilitate future development.
