# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a To-Do List Web Application

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a detailed description of the requirements for a simple To-Do List web application. The purpose of this application is to help users manage their tasks effectively.

### 1.2 Scope

The application will allow users to create, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The initial version will be a standalone web application without user authentication. Future versions may include user accounts and data persistence.

### 1.3 Target Audience

This document is intended for project stakeholders, including developers, testers, and project managers.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The To-Do List web application is a new, self-contained product. It will be a simple, single-page web application.

### 2.2 Product Features

The main features of the application are:
*   Adding new tasks
*   Viewing the list of tasks
*   Editing existing tasks
*   Deleting tasks
*   Marking tasks as complete or incomplete

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

The primary user is anyone who wants to manage a list of tasks. No special technical skills are required.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

The application will be a web-based application and will run in modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. It will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

*   The application must be a single-page application (SPA).
*   The user interface should be simple and intuitive.
*   No backend server or database will be used for the initial version. Data will be stored in the browser's local storage.

## 3. System Features (Functional Requirements)

### 3.1 Task Creation

*   **FR-1:** The user shall be able to add a new task to the to-do list.
*   **FR-2:** Each task shall have a description.
*   **FR-3:** A newly created task shall be marked as "incomplete" by default.

### 3.2 Task Viewing

*   **FR-4:** The user shall be able to see a list of all their tasks.
*   **FR-5:** Each task in the list shall display its description and its completion status.

### 3.3 Task Editing

*   **FR-6:** The user shall be able to edit the description of an existing task.

### 3.4 Task Deletion

*   **FR-7:** The user shall be able to delete a task from the to-do list.

### 3.5 Mark Task as Complete/Incomplete

*   **FR-8:** The user shall be able to mark a task as "complete".
*   **FR-9:** The user shall be able to mark a "complete" task back to "incomplete".
*   **FR-10:** Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from incomplete tasks (e.g., with a strikethrough).

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces

*   The application will have a clean and simple user interface.
*   An input field will be provided for adding new tasks.
*   An "Add" button will submit the new task.
*   The list of tasks will be displayed clearly.
*   Each task item will have controls for editing, deleting, and marking as complete.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

*   **NFR-1:** The application should load in under 3 seconds on a standard internet connection.
*   **NFR-2:** UI updates (adding, editing, deleting tasks) should feel instantaneous, with no noticeable lag.

### 5.2 Usability

*   **NFR-3:** The application should be easy to use for non-technical users.
*   **NFR-4:** All functionalities should be discoverable and accessible with minimal clicks.

### 5.3 Reliability

*   **NFR-5:** The application should function correctly in the specified browsers.
*   **NFR-6:** Data stored in local storage should persist between browser sessions.

### 5.4 Security

*   **NFR-7:** As there is no user authentication or server-side processing, security requirements are minimal. The application should not expose the user to any cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

### 5.5 Maintainability

*   **NFR-8:** The code should be well-structured, commented, and easy to understand for future development.
